# The problem

ChorChain is a model-driven framework based on Blockchain technology. It supports the whole life-cycle of BPMN Choreographies from their modelling to their distributed execution.

How do we prevent anyone from copying someones signature. We do so by generating a Private key / public Key pair.

So far so good, we managed to map BPMN logic into code that runs in a distributed fashion on a blockchain.

The next issues are the following:
- How can this be automated?
- And How can we limit the visibility of certain actions?

---

- Why not use some already existing work from Chorchain. (It's already capable of transforming BPMN into Solidity smart contracts).
- As engineers, we are not supposed to reinvent the wheel.
- The second issue is still the privacy issue

## Running smart contracts on Sawtooth 


The primary goal of the Sawtooth-Ethereum integration project, affectionately dubbed "Seth", is to add support for running Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts to the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. In order to make this possible, the Hyperledger Sawtooth project worked with the Hyperledger Burrow project to integrate their EVM implementation, the Burrow EVM, into with the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform.

How can achieve Transaction privacy ? 

---


![approaches](docs/privacy_diagram.png)


---

The only way to limit visbility of a Transactions Processor so far is to use encryption with Public key
- This feature is not available by default on sawtooth so we wrote a script that manages to do that
