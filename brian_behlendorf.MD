Transcription from episode 160 epicenter podcast


having a giant ledger, keeping track of when they are being transfered.
it was more just about currency, trying to change how systems work around the world. usecases. trying diamond trade in the diamond industry. keeping blood diamonds away.
Land reformation, record selling houses and so forth. keeping corrupt bureaucrats from stealing . you can eliminate paper trail unless you have a public ledger.

Passion for opensource, opendata, reform the deep structural social problems out there in the world. 
He became frustrated. they were getting a lot of money. they would talk about amazing ideas, they would spend on plumbing, fork of bitcoin/eth, with the idea even in the decentralized, they could be the gateway. They wanted to be the google or the aws of the space. the one default everyone had to turn to because they did it faster/better.  
How internet technologies really succeed on common plumbing infr, and building on top and doing into differentiated areas. blockchain based app for a specific app for healthcare/supply chain. remove the plumbing. the bitcoin was coming from a payment, the eth com was focused on the decentralized airbnb and uber.
There is al ot of disruption on payment industry, internet technology and the web were successfull because we had our stallman. Long term visions of where we wanted to get to. going through a phase change to switch to decentralized

When it launched, 2017 first annoucenement, consensus conf, there is something a lack. there was a need for it.

declaration of cyber space , john perry barlow check it out  (https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)

internet has become overcentralized. that is economically lot of the rewards go to few organizations. its also not resilient. entire channels of coms are cut off. others might step in, but that's fragile. Anti-fragility. blockchains can achieve that. global scale or local scale, small group of non profits or banks or political , public or private, governed by the sense of governance.

on consensus, what are the needs of Hyperledger would fix:

there was no open source community, like what we saw in the apache software foundation, community is what comes first, you have to make the project a multi-stake project, bring new devs to come, exit and onbarding otherwise they burn out. Feedback loop and effective governance on the project itself. ASF has 300 projects under it (community > code). quality code is a byproduct. there was a need to separate of governance and writing software, and managing standards. and 3rd the governance and managing a global consensus.

apache building a web server. ITF http standards, CA browser forum managing the global certificate hierarchy for top level certificates auths that we preload to our browsers. the crypto com was combining them into one to bootstrap. causing tensions and different interests of people (smart contracts , companies, holding tokens). tensions wasn't being resolved when we had these 3 tensions in the same community. LInux foundation and asf has figured that out. hyperledger it made sense of that


what kind of conflicts / divergent interests in the crypt world:

in LF, micrsofot starting callign it cancer in 2001/2002. and then acknowledge the existing to open source. 2016 joining the LF as a platinum member. there are late to the party. other major companies of the LF as a long time. where does most of the energy comes from the people (scaling new file system, features ... super computing cluster ), much of that is corporate funding, IBM, HP are doing their bit to invest in linux. the foundation had to be a balancing act without disturbing what makes open source, talking objectively what / how / why build things, put egoes aside. how to converge on a common body of code. allowing 20 different FS in the kernel. 1 or 2 will settle down and become the dominant.

lets allow the arch to organically emerge. not top-down. couple of different smart contracts engines, zkp engines that are intersting that might compete. compettion isnt bad. all under the same license. i can borrow good ideas, you can borrow and we can let darwin tell us which are the best. we're also responding to the public.


long term and blockchain space, if it is a great success. what kind of impact will it have on the community, and what if things go wrong:   

constant churn at the lower levels, constant debates ego-driven and driven by the tokens that would color ones' opinion. poisonous opionions, in infra and very little at solving the big problems. can we apply this tech to improve the food supply chain. use this to give identities to refugees. spend less time about plumbing we do things faster. the success story every good idea about consensus and smart is given an opportunity to flourish and quickly switch to good quality code. don't waste time on useless debating. 


there are multiple projects under the umbrella, each of them is like an apache project, mission, name set of devs, maintainers, looking to bring new maintatiners to get healthy growth, own agenda, own priorities, they decide the release. we encourage, same license, same naming convetions for packages. nomenclature in place, every project needs a name and be distinct, they also need as communities they need to be paying attentions to each other, potentially to merge efforts. apache doesn't care what the codebase does or will converge. that's fine and there is maybe room for that, but we encourage these projects, competition is great, but lets see if there are places where we can integrate.

if we can condense something. bottom=s up encouragement, over time we will get to a smaller set of standardized archs. multiple DLT engines inside hyperledger, for the same reason , in the db world, we have mysql and we have cassandra, different arch and different promises to the layer above them, that means down to their core they are different db's. diversity is something we need in order to move fast and try new ideas and build high quality software. sport thinking, who is the one. we can have some guarantee of the trustworthiness of the code, and bugs can get fixed.  

the Linux foundation is a consortium, different than the apache foundation, public charity, membership based or maybe a union. the linux foundation is a traditional industrial consortium, standards bodies, it means that our work is funded by companies or are members and then the individual projects. the LF is gone beyond the Linux OS, and 30 different projects, plumbing. industries that benefit from OSS and commit the resources and faciliate these projects. apache fx there are some sponsors, no full time staff, contractors for sysadminds, and for PR resources, and legal advice, they dont pay Execs, they have a full time secretary. that can work but that volunteriism people that can afford to do it. it's rare and hard and few companies to do that. the LF different approach how to fund all the things you need to do to make OSS work. nothing to do to write code. we pay for lawyers. to reassure companies that they can use it. Demonstrate the providence of the code. someone is watching, everything follows a path. no worry about a submarine pattent, or building a business and discovering that they have rights to that code. Marketing as well, OSS actually needs it, for the press. Avoiding one business dominating the conversation, so we need to managed these things. you dont get vetos or priorities, you have to alter the project you have to go through the standard path. whether feature X is the right way. long story short, the model is to bring these companies together (100 sponsors for hyperledger project, IBM, intel, JPMorgan ...). 25 are in mainland china, Huawei, chinese startupts doing energy blockchain things.



using tokens, and tokens are new ways of funding plumbing infra, crowdsale with eth and many others ... we can monetize things and fund projects. 

nytime you turn something to a currency. gov attention, regulations maybe when you dont need it. introcudes speculation, it would be nice to work on a protocol ... DNS would;ve worked better in the early days if every client sends a penny every request. (DNS business model). email as well, stop spam. more commercial, less free. when we bring the speculators, they are driven to take advantage where there are information gaps, in an env, taking advantage ends up costing real money. their gains is our loss. dont tokenize everything, how do you reward partiicpation in a global consensus. If your goal is 100M of nodes that our share a ledger. for a lot of consortium you dont need a token to incentivize participation in a consortium.

20 banks t o record txs, there is inherint to partiicpate, and provide the approprioate resources. or dns server or email server. no need for tokenization. so much of the internet is the motive of interconnect and enhance the lives of people, making money wasnt a secondary goal. better answer for the publishing world, reward quality journalism instead of ads. we are at the end of that cycle. currencies have the role more competing currencies. every Dapps are not into it. lot of people stay away from this space, because of this nature. Then we can bring the mainstream CS and dev field.    


Licensing: (legal process)

hyperledgers approach to licensing.

the inbound license (contributions) dev certificate of origin. similar to contributor license agreements. ways of devs to attest the fact the contribution they made, they have permissions to contribute. 3rd party libraries and the license was LGPL, incompatible, or a whacky self-declared OSS. we can't use it in gov / commercial purposes. reminder to devs to check the license. Reassurance legal integrity of the project.
Outbound (apache license). it was designed very carefully. as permissive as the orignal BSD license. there are number of things to matter later on, you need to grant reasurrance to all the users, anyone with a patent that might read, that patent rights also flow through. Serve as a contributor license agreement back anytime someone made a derivative work. just as free MIT or BSD + extra reasurrance. australian guy made a patent on the satoshi's concepts convicing that he was satoshi. pow. had satoshis releases under apache or MIT, we would have implicent rights to patent even the ones not granted yet. PoW you wanna know if someone has a golden ticket, 5 years from now, be able to seek a penny per tx from anybody from that system. we should view a bare MIT or BSD license as having this risk. apache seems more thoughtful for corporate lawyers and they understand it. 
if you put the GPL lawyers, takes some time. one is our industry, we are tlaking to a lot of companies that are new to OSS. legal departments are new to it, big learning curve. GPL wont be a cancer on their own IP. represens of additional months for a legal team and accept that.
There are opinions how to enforce the GPL, GPLv3 and APGL get even stronger. Torvald is coming out against the people that use the GPL as weapons, that companies that are bundling linux in the hardware. follow the rules of GPL and release derivatives owrk. what's linked and what's in the package, is a grey area. scares away companies and collaboration ona project like hyperledger. apache is the right choice. can still rewards as derivatives and add on to bring them upstream. the forking is a risk no matter what license yo uare under. community dynamic.
