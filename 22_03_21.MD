EthSigner acts as a proxy service by forwarding requests to the Ethereum client. When EthSigner receives a transaction it generates a signature using the stored private key, and forwards the signed transaction to the Ethereum client.

Note: Besu does not implement `eth_sendTransaction()`, we must use `eth_sendRawTransaction` and sign it ourself or instead call `localhost:8545` the default rpc node, we call the ethSigner node that signs it for us `localhost:18545` with `eth_sendTransaction`

In order to send private transactions however, we need to use `eea_sendRawTransaction` instead of `eth_sendTransaction` which generates a privacy marker transaction and submits it to the tx pool, and returns the transaction hash of the privacy marker transaction. Essentially storing some information publically and some privately.

here comes the hart part. This method would not throw an exception when called and would just exit.

The `web3j.eea` package needs v4.8.4
The `web3j.besu` uses as well v4.8.4
The `web3j.org` uses as well v4.8.4


I realized that maybe the signing method in utils was wrong .... or just the wrong version

updated `web3j.utils` `web3j.crypto` from version 4.1.1 to version 4.8.4 and it worked

Still need to cleanup and fix the interface to select nodes that would have access to the private smart contract and so on ... 

---

1. Run ChorChain ✅
2. Besu public transactions ✅
3. Besu private transactions ✅ (ni) 
4. GoQuorum public tx ❌
5. GoQuorum private tx ❌
6. Interface and code cleanup ❌
